1. INTRODUCTION
Product Overview

Eurotech’s Kura is an inclusive and targeted software framework.  Kura allows Eurotech to deliver not only the latest generation Pervasive Computer hardware platforms, but also all aspects of the required software stack:

<ul>
  <li>Bootloader/BIOS for hardware platform</li>
  <li>Operating System (Linux)</li>
  <li>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</li>
  <li>OSGi application framework</li>
  <li>Extensive set of ready-to-use Java Plug-Ins (Bundles) provided for unique platform supplied hardware, network, cellular, and storage applications</li>
</ul>
All of these components come “integrated” from Eurotech and are based on open standards, tools, and implementations.  The amount of 3rd party development is greatly reduced, allowing customers to focus on what they do best – writing their business application logic without having to spend man-years developing the software infrastructure and frameworks upon which those applications can run.
